The work presented in this article was partially presented in our publication â€œGRAIL: Scalable Reachability Index for Large Graphs"  which appears in the proceedings of the VLDB conference of 2010. The part of work in this article which is not published in any other archival publication is given as follows:
  * Detailed descriptions of applications and the preliminaries of interval labeling approaches (section 1)
  * Enhancements/Optimizations such as "topological level filter" and "positive cut filter" (section 5)
    * We presented the conference paper as the "Basic Grail" and the new method with these optimizations as the default GRAIL approach. In fact GRAIL has significantly better performance than Basic Grail.
  * Descriptions of new traversal strategies for index construction (section 3.2)
o experimental evaluation in section 6.4.3
    * Detailed description of exception list construction and pseudocode (section 4)
  * Experimental evaluation of the baseline methods (6.3) and different search strategies (6.4.1)
  * Experiments are detailed for (6.4.2) and (6.4.4)
  * A competitive method-GRIPP- is added to the comparisons
